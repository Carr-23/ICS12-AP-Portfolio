    </p>
    <p>Meet Dan. Dan is a writer for the Disney Channel. His hit show, “Phineas and Ferb,” has reached levels of
        popularity no one has ever seen before. The kids who watch his show always love it, because Dan maintains a
        constant level of creativity. How does he do this?</p>
    <p>Well, before Dan writes anything, he visits his seven-story mansion, asks his housekeeper for a drink of orange
        juice, sits down at his study, pulls out a sheet of paper, and begins to map out his story.</p>
    <p>How does Dan create the entire plot of the episode at once? Easy. Everything he writes on the page is just a
        sequence of events, or plot. Setting, character development, and how his characters interact is all taken care
        of elsewhere. How does he do that? Let's find out.</p>
    <p>You see, Dan, more than anything else, is orderly and consistent. It's what has made his books so popular. Let's
        say that he has just sat down to write “Episode 233”, his two hundred and thirty-third episode.</p>
    <p>The first thing that Dan needs is a setting. So he pulls down a binder he has marked "Phineas and Ferb Episode,”
        opens to the first page, and reads the first few lines:</p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p style="padding-left:25%;padding-right:25%;">Every city in Phineas and Ferb has a few characteristics:
            citizens, malls, and a couple inventors. A standard City would have one mall and be located in a tri-state
            area during summer vacation.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="green">This description of a city, while not very profound, did two important things: 1) It established
        the key ingredients for a city in Phineas and Ferb and 2) It gave several values that might occur in such a
        city. (Any more than one mall and the economy collapses.)</p>
    <div class="textbox brown">
        <p style="padding-left:25%;padding-right:25%;">
            City <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has a certain number of citizens <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has a certain number of malls <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has a certain number of inventors <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            is located somewhere <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            exists at a certain time <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            a typical City would have <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            number of malls = 1 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            location = Tri-State Area <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            time period = Summer Of 2008 <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="brown">It may seem that Dan has a strange way of writing, but to him, it's straightforward. The first
        line on the page states that Dan is defining a typical American city. You may have noticed that when Dan needs
        to write two words, he won't use a space. There is a reason for this. If he puts spaces in, his editor in New
        York, a stickler for details, gets confused. So to prevent him from being confused he removes spaces and adds a
        capital before every word to show its a new word in the sentence. </p>
    <p class="brown">The next step, logically, is to then declare what sorts of variables (those things which define
        how the town looks) that a class of Danville might have. Citizens, malls, inventors, etc. That being said, all
        that was left to do was to construct a sample City, with default values for his variables. Whew!</p>
    <div class="textbox purple">
        <p>

            public class City<br>
            {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            int citizens;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            int malls;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            int inventors;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            String location;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            String time;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            public City()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            malls = 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            location = “Tri-State Area";<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            time = “Summer Of 2008”;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            }<br>
            }<br>

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="purple">
        <p>In creating his Phineas and Ferb City, Dan is defining a class, not the city itself (because that would be
            an
            object). A class is like a (really mixing metaphors here) recipe without any measurements. It says what
            elements should be in a Phineas and Ferb City, but does not say in what amounts.
        </p>
        <p>This is the process of declaring what the variables will be called, and what sort of values they will
            contain.
            For now, just worry about "int"s and "String"s. "int" stands for integer, and "String" for a string of
            letters.</p>
        <p>The semi-colon is Dan's way of letting his editor know that he is done with the preceding statement and that
            he
            can move on to the next one. For the most part, you can think of it like a period.</p>
        <p>Finally, you'll notice that whenever Dan wants to group a set of statements, he uses a curly brace, "{".
            Even
            though Dan knows his characters very well, this lets his editor see where a group of statements begins and
            ends. Any class will always end with all the open curly braces being closed.</p>
        <p>If Dan does create (instantiate) a city object eventually in his book, his editor will look to the same City
            class to determine what that town object should look like (Dan will send the binders along with his
            manuscript). But where will his editor find out the number of stables and such? This is where we get into
            the
            constructor.</p>
        <p>The constructor comes after all of the variables have been declared. It starts with public City(). The
            statements that follow are the default values for his variables; how Dan's city object would look if he
            simply
            instantiated it in his plot without specifying any of its values.</p>
    </div>
    <p>So now we've sneaked a peak at one of Dan's binders. He has reviewed the city section and thinks that this
        episode should take place in a city. So he's ready to write the first part of his plot. Dan turns to the main
        paper that is sitting in the middle of his desk and starts to write the story. </p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p class=>
            Episode 233<br>
            <br>
            This episode takes place in a city called Danville. Danville has one mall, 241,000 citizens, and two
            inventors.

        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="green">Just a couple lines, but Dan has, in fact, said quite a bit. When he sends the story to his
        editor, he will look
        up "City" in the binders he sends along and fill in the date, location, and number of malls. In addition, Dan
        has added information about the number of citizens and inventors. But that's okay, because his editor was
        expecting it. Because his binder stated that every city would have a certain number of these, but didn't say
        how many, his editor was quite happy to see them specified in his plot. Even though his main plot page only has
        two lines, because of the reference to his binder, his story already contains quite a bit of information.</p>
    <div class="textbox brown">
        <p>
            Main Episode233<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            City danville is a new City.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The number of malls is one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The number of citizens is 241000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The number of inventors is two.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="brown">Dan takes two very important steps early on in his plot. First, he instantiates an object of type
        City. Having created his first object, Dan then goes on to fill out the information that was initially lacking
        in the City class: (number of malls, citizens, inventors )</p>
    <div class="textbox purple">
        <p>
            public class Episode233{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            public static void main (String arguments[]) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            City danville = new City;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            danville.malls = 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            danville.citizens = 241000;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            danville.inventors = 2; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            }<br>
            }

        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="purple">Dan sure has a strange way of saying things, doesn't he? It would be possible to explain what each
        word in those first two lines does, but it wouldn't make much sense to you at this point, and it would really
        tax my small brain, so let's skip it for now, eh? What's important to know is that that line is how Dan let's
        his editor know that this piece of paper is his main routine, or plot.</p>
    <p class="purple">When he decides to specify those variables (saloons, etc) that were not specified in the WesternTown
        class, Dan first states the name of the object (in this case, danville. Remember that danville is an object of
        City) followed by a period and then by the name of the variable. Having done this, Dan can then provide a value
        for the variable, such as two.</p>
    <p>So, believe it or not, you've just seen object-oriented programming in action. Our author Dan first created a
        class (that was the binder) that roughly described a city, then turned to his main plot page and created
        (instantiated) a city object, which he then called danville.</p>
    <p>Now, for his MadScientist, Dan needs a different binder. So he puts "Cities" back on the shelf, and goes to pick
        up a new binder. his hand passes over many different titles, like "Animals", "Weapons", "Weather", "Music", all
        the essentials for a good Western, until he finally comes to the binder he wants: "Citizens". he opens up to
        the introduction: </p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p>"All citizens have a certain number of outfits, age, shoes, and number of pets. They are either male or
            female, have a name, have a pet with a name, and have different IQ levels. If someone asks, humans can
            respond with their name."</p>
    </div>
    <p class="green">You'll notice that Dan likes to make all characteristics variables. This gives his the freedom to
        change their values later in the story. You'll note that he left the sex, name, pet name, and IQ level
        unspecified. </p>
    <p class="green">Just so all of his citizens don't look identical, Dan prefers to specify those variables when he
        writes the plot.</p>
    <div class="textbox brown">
        <p>Citizens<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a certain number of outfits<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a certain age<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a certain number of shoes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a certain number of pets<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a name for their pet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a certain sex<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Have a certain IQ level<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            A standard human would start with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            one outfit<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            two shoes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            one pet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            When someone asks for your name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            tell them your name <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            When someone asks for your pets name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            tell them your pet's name <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="brown">You, being as sharp as you are, notice that Dan's human has some interactivity. He can ask its
        name, and it will respond, he can asks his pets name and he will also respond. This is called a method and is
        your key to a good time. We'll get to it in just a few pages.</p>
    <div class="textbox purple">
        <p>
            public class Citizens {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            int outfits;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            return name;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            }<br>
            }
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="purple">Boy, it all makes sense except that bit about that "public String whatIsYourName()" business, eh?
        Don't worry. We'll get to all that in just a little bit.</p>
    <p>As interesting as these descriptions of humans may be, however, they're not very specific. Dan promised his
        editor a new story by Friday, so he decides to get down to business. Flipping through the "Humans" binder, he
        comes to the first chapter, entitled "MadScientists".</p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p>Mad scientists are based on the idea of citizens. They are identical, except that they have some additional
            qualities, namely a headquarters, an evil laugh, some level of meanness, a certain quantity of weapons in
            their possession, and a number of children. Your standard MadScientist will have an evil laugh and start the
            day out nice. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="green">Nothing really new here, except that we have peered deeper into Dan's binders (classes) to see one
        of the subsections (subclasses). This particular subsection, mad scientists, extended the idea of humans.</p>
    <div class="textbox brown">
        <p>
            MadScientists extends the idea of Humans. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            A MadScientists<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has a headquarter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has an evil laugh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has some level of meanness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has certain amount of weapons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            For a given MadScientists,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            He will start out nice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            He will have an evil laugh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="purple">We have introduced here the idea of subclasses. "Humans"; was a class, and "MadScientist" a subclass
        of it.</p>
    <p class="purple">You may also be wondering why Dan declared "Citizens child" in this class. Think of it this way. If
        the MadScientist is going to have a daughter, Dan's editor has to know what a daughter is. By declaring
        "Citizens daughter", his editor will know that a daughter is a type of citizen.</p>
    <p>After Dan had described what his mad scientist looked like, he decides to move on to some of the methods
        (remember those from a few pages ago?) that mad scientists employ to achieve their dastardly deeds. Dan wants
        to focus on how mad scientists make new weapons. So he writes:</p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p>Whenever the main plot says that a mad scientist makes a new weapon, his level of meanness will go up by
            one. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="green">While this may not look any different than any of the things that we were doing before, you should
        note that Dan
        is specifying how one of his characters acts, rather than just how he/she/it looks. You should also note that
        he is altering one of his variables here, the variable "meanness". Since his binders (classes) can contain
        information about how his characters act, Dan can create quite a bit of character development without ever even
        touching his main plot page.</p>
    <div class="textbox brown">
        <p>
            buildWeapon<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            meanness increases by one

        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="brown">Notice the pattern than has begun to emerge in Dan's writing. What he has done with this method is
        similar to how he treated variables in the past. First, he notes what he is going to describe (in this case a
        method called meanness) and then, on the next line, what that method will do when he calls it in his main plot
        (routine).</p>
    <div class="textbox purple">
        <p>
            public void buildWeapon() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            meanness ++;<br>
            }

        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="purple">Although Dan used quite a bit of strange symbols, his approach was straightforward and consistent.
        The first thing that he did was to name the method "buildWeapon". Since the method name is buildWeapon, Dan
        figures that he should modify the MadScientist's number of weapons, in this case by adding one to it. That is
        what the "++" after "weapons" does.</p>
    <p>Now, the mad scientists in Dan's stories are famous for being mean. Hence, it's very difficult for an onlooker
        to gauge how mean they are. Dan decides that it's a good idea to allow his mad scientist to state how mean he
        is, so, he writes a new method:</p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p>If someone asks a mad scientist how mean he is, the mad scientist will always respond with his level of
            meanness.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="textbox brown">
        <p>
            howMeanAmI<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            tell them how mean I am

        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="textbox purple">
        <p>
            public int howMeanAmI() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            return meanness;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            }


        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="purple">If you're wondering about that "int" in front of the "howMeanAmI()", Dan had to put that in because
        this method has a return value. In order to let the editor know what sort of value was being returned, he
        specified "int" (for integer) in front of the name of the method. Remember, his editor doesn't like surprises,
        and if he didn't tell his what sort of variable this method was going to return, he'd get all hot and
        flustered. (Now, we don't want that, do we?)</p>
    <p>At this point Dan is pretty proud of himself, having created a mad scientist that can experience pretty much the
        full range of MadScientistous activities. However, just to make for a good closing, Dan decides to have the mad
        scientist adopt a daughter. he sets out to write one more method. What makes this different than his other
        methods is that it needs information about someone other than the mad scientist, namely the daughter to be
        adopted. </p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p>If the MadScientistsis supposed to adopt a daughter, adopt the specified daughter, then add one to the
            number of daughters he has adopted. Then print out "Wow! (the specified daughter) has been adopted!" </p>
    </div>
    <p class="green">So now you can see the flexibility that Dan has in writing his stories; he can leave certain
        things to be
        specified only when the plot is written. And by writing that the daughter will have a name, but not stating
        what it will be, that's just what he has done. He has also used a print statement that will print out the
        information gathered by the method as an event in his book. How easy! </p>
    <div class="textbox brown">
        <p>
            adoptDaughter (Citizens daughter)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            add one to the number of daughters this MadScientists has adopted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            print "How nice! (the specified daughter) has been adopted!

        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="brown">I have nothing to say to you people. If you feel bad about understanding everything so far, then
        you can read the purple section for this one.</p>
    <div class="textbox purple">
        <p>
            public void adoptDaughter (Citizens daughter) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            this.daughter = daughter;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            daughters++;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            System.out.println("The Mad Scientist has adopted " + daughter.whatIsYourName());<br>
            }

        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="purple">"Geez! I should have stayed with the green type," you're probably saying to yourself. Don't worry.
        It looks much worse than it is, and you probably understand most of it already. First, we have the name of the
        method: "adoptDaughter". No surprise there. Then, between those parentheses, we have "Citizens daughter". What
        comes between those parentheses is called an argument. It helps make the method more specific. When Dan starts
        writing his plot, he will at some point want his Mad Scientist to adopt a daughter (what sort of heartwarming
        scientist would we have without it?). But if he just writes in his plot, "MadScientist.adoptDaughter()", that
        wouldn't be very exciting for the reader. Who has been tied up? What is his name? Priding herself on always
        having strong female characters, Dan wants to add the name of the damsel who is being tied up. Hence, when his
        plot says "adoptDaughter", it will also say the name of the damsel being tied up as an argument. "Citizens",
        which comes before "daughter", tells his editor that the thing being tied up is a citizen. His editor doesn't
        like surprises, so that knowing that it is a citizen being tied up, rather than say, a sheep, reduces the
        amount of guesswork on his end.</p>
    <p class="purple">The next line is another attempt by Dan to please his rather persnickety editor, who is even more
        picky than he is! Even though he has supplied the name of the damsel as an argument, his editor won't let his
        use it in the method until he has stated that the "daughter" that he declared as a "MadScientists" variable is
        equal to the value given in the method's argument. Having finally jumped through all of his editor's hoops
        (don't expect to understand all of that right away, it took Dan a couple of weeks!), Dan gets down to finishing
        the rest of his method. Once the MadScientist has tied up a damsel, the variable "daughters" will surely go up
        by one, so Dan puts the same "++" after daughters that he had put after "meanness" in the "lookInMirror"
        example.</p>
    <p class="purple">The stage being set, Dan decides that it is time to let his readers know what is going on. Hence,
        the "System.out.println" statement. A bit wordy, but it lets his editor know that what comes between those
        parentheses goes into the final text of the book: all the text he puts in between quotation marks. Why is the
        variable daughter.whatIsYourName' then not in quotation marks? Because it is not a literal, but rather an
        object's method. By keeping it out of the quotation marks, Dan lets his editor know that he has to go look for
        the daughter object (he would find out that it was of the "Citizens" class) then for the method
        "whatIsYourName" (he would see that it returned the daughter’s name). All of that for a daughter’s name!</p>
    <p class="purple">Had he put daughter.whatIsYourName inside of the quotation marks, his editor would have printed out
        in the final copy of the book : "The Mad Scientist has adopted “ + daughter.whatIsYourName!". No Pulitzers for
        that. In order for his editor to substitute the variable name for the word name, Dan closes the quotation marks
        before he writes it. The plus "+" lets his editor know that he wants to join the two statements.
    </p>
    <p class="purple">Lucky for you, the next page is just review.</p>
    <p>At this point, it might be a good idea to review what Dan's overall description of a MadScientist looks like.
        None of this material is new, just a compilation of what we've gone over in the past few pages.</p>
    <div class="textbox green">
        <p>Mad scientists are based on the idea of citizens. They are identical, except that they have some additional
            qualities, namely a headquarters, an evil laugh, some level of meanness, and a certain quantity of weapons
            in their possession. Your standard MadScientist will have an evil laugh, start the day out nice, and not
            yet have adopted any daughters.
            Whenever the main plot says that a mad scientists makes a new weapon, his level of meanness will go up by
            one. If someone asks a mad scientist how mean he is, the mad scientist will always respond with his level
            of meanness. If the mad scientist is supposed to adopt a daughter, adopt the specified daughter, then add
            one to the number of daughters he has adopted. Then print out "Wow! (the specified daughter) has been
            adopted!"

    </div>
    <p>"That's his book?" you ask yourself. "Thirteen pages of slogging through ugly yellow text for this?"</p>
    <p>So what is so special about this plot? Well, it's not everything that's happening in the main routine, but
        rather everything that happens behind the scenes. When Dan created that town called Danville, he created
        <b>(instantiated)</b> an <b>object</b> of type city. This object had all the characteristics of a city (do you
        remember the
        binders?) The same thing goes for the Heinz object and the Vanessa object. While some of the traits of these
        objects were specified at the time of creation, most of their traits were specified back in the binders, or
        classes. This allowed Dan to say a good deal while only saying a little bit in his <b>main routine.</b></p>
    <p>So Dan's main plot (routine) turns out to be nothing more than a collection of references to objects, which in
        turn are references to classes. It is, to mix metaphors again, literary federalism, with everything being dealt
        with at the lowest level possible.</p>
    <p>So what are the benefits of this? Well, imagine that instead of one episode, Dan's editor wanted five hundred.
        Or let's say that Dan decided that Heinz the mad scientist shouldn't be so cruel. Instead of going back and
        laboriously changing all his instances of Heinz making weapons (or whatever it is that bad folks do), Dan could
        just make some changes to the Heinz object at the time of instantiation. Or he could change the Mad Scientist
        class to be friendlier. Or he could even create a *new* class, called Friendly MadScientist. He's got a lot of
        options; the point is that he only needs to make the changes in one place.</p>
    <p>But that's not Dan's only reason for writing his episodes in Java. He has a keen idea for the future of Phineas
        and Ferb. he sees interactivity. And if, instead of being bound in pages, his characters live in objects and
        classes, Dan is free to create a Virtual Danville. Readers (on his website) could be prompted for their own
        actions and his characters could respond in a variety of ways, according to what was written in their classes.
        Using Java, Dan could finally bring Danville to life. </p>
    <p><b>So who is this editor fellow?</b></p>
    <p>You've seen many references to Dan's editor in New York. Who is this fellow? Well, he knows the world of
        Danville in and out, and he knows that certain things will just not work in a good episode. That is why his
        editor takes all of Dan's scripts, reads them, and then returns them with all the errors that he has made
        (remember, we said that he was a bit persnickety). On the computer, this is called a <b>compiler.</b> All Java
        programs must be <b>compiled</b> before they can be run. The compiler will patiently (and repeatedly) tell you
        everything that you did wrong. And then you get to go back and do it again.
